# Epicodus Independent Project - March 13, 2020

### Created by: Brandan Sayarath

## Description

This is the Epicodus independent end-of-week assignment for Friday, March 13, 2020.  The purpose of this assignment is to build an MVC application to help track vendors that purchase baked goods from a bakery and track the orders belonging to those vendors.  For example, the bakery might supply croissants to a vendor called "Suzie's Cafe" once a week. The bakery may want to create a new Vendor to represent the cafe and add new Orders to it to help keep track of their expanding business relationships.
